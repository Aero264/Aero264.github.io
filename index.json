[{"content":"Perturbations in Epilepsy is a hot-topics workshop series organized by the Center for Systems Modelling and Quantitative Biomedicine (SMQB) in association with the University of Birmingham, UK.\nEpilepsy is a chronic and complex neurological disorder affecting about 65 million people around the world. It manifests as pathological electrical activity in the brain, and may lead to recurrent, unprovoked seizures, affecting the quality of life. Several physiological factors are known to affect the seizure likelihood, including sleep, hormones, and stress. It is imperative to understand the role of these triggers so that they can be identified and avoided. However, the triggers may affect different individuals in different ways and their effects may change over time even within the same individual. We are organising this workshop series to better understand how various seizure triggers affect the brain networks and predispose them to a seizure.\nWe hosted the first edition at the Edgbaston Park Hotel in the University of Birmingham Campus on April 6 and 7, 2022. We brought together experts from different backgrounds to further our mechanistic understanding of the interplay between brain networks, seizure likelihood and these physiological triggers.\nThe first edition highlighted that the perceived unpredictability of seizures is the primary concern among patients with epilepsy and explored how this could be addressed. In June this year, we will host the second edition of the workshop to explore how we could predict or prevent seizures through long-term monitoring of seizure triggers using smartwatches and EEG headbands. The event will take place at the Edgbaston Park Hotel on June 26 and 27, 2023.\nWe are planning three thematic sessions for the second edition of the workshop:\nIn the first session, we will have clinicians sharing their perspectives about seizures and their triggers. In the second session, we will have representatives from the industry presenting solutions/devices that could help monitor seizure triggers. In the third session, we will have academics sharing their perspectives how this data could be included in seizure prediction and prevention. We have an exciting line-up of speakers joining us from clinical research, academia and industry including Garmin Health, UNEEG and Neuronostics. We look forward to hosting everyone at the workshop!\n","date":"February 19, 2023","permalink":"/events/pie23/","section":"Events","summary":"Perturbations in Epilepsy is a hot-topics workshop series organized by the Center for Systems Modelling and Quantitative Biomedicine (SMQB) in association with the University of Birmingham, UK.","title":"Perturbations in Epilepsy 2023"},{"content":"My colleague Dr. Yingjing Feng and I are organising and chairing a mini symposium on ‘Phase Transitions in Electrophysiological Systems’ at the upcoming SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems in Portland, USA on May 17 and 18, 2023. Delegates from five countries, spanning different career stages from Graduate students to Senior Professors will be giving talks at the symposium.\nPhase transitions are ubiquitous in physiological processes and systems, for instance, the transition between quiescence and firing in neurons, rhythmic and arrhythmic oscillations in the heart and synchronous and asynchronous oscillations in a network of pancreatic cells. Many a time, these transitions are also indicative of the shift from a healthy state to disease. For instance, synchronous bursting of neurons may lead up to a seizure.\nApproaches based on nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory have been imperative in improving our understanding of these transitions and developing techniques to detect an impending transition. As such, they find applications in seizure detection (neuroscience), cardiac arrhythmias (cardiology), and insulin secretion (endocrinology), to name a few.\nThe breadth of both approaches and applications motivated us to organise this mini symposium on the subject to enable cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques. We intend to provide a platform to present different approaches adopted in studying phase transitions and deliberate over their merits and limitations relative to different applications such as,\nNeuroscience, including neurodegenerative diseases, sleep, circadian and ultradian cycles.

Energy harvesters are small devices that can convert otherwise wasted energy, such as heat and vibrations in the environment, into a small amount of electricity. One could then use this electricity to power wireless sensors and small devices - for instance, a vibration energy harvester could use vibrations from a railway track to power sensors that monitor structural integrity of the tracks. I worked on how we could enhance the performance of vibration energy harvesters that use piezoelectric transduction to generate energy.\nAfter completing my PhD, I moved to the UK to work on the development of a software package that enables bottom-up modelling of helicopters at the University of Bristol. I was part of a £3.5 million project involving multiple UK universities to develop new experimental and computational methods for the analysis of tiltrotor helicopters. My task was to develop a software framework that could allow designing of the individual components of the helicopter, and then automatically assembles them to simulate the motion of the entire helicopter. I developed a comprehensive software capable of simulating any mechanical system, not just a helicopter. However, there are some limitations - the software could handle only rigid systems. Researchers at Bristol continue to work on the software, adding more functionality, including the capability to model flexible systems, while I have moved to Birmingham since October 2021 in the pursuit of diversifying my knowledge.\nCurrently, I am a Research Fellow in Computational Neuroscience at the Center for Systems Modelling and Quantitative Biomedicine (SMQB) at the Univeristy of Birmingham, UK. I am investigating the effects of triggers such as stress, sleep deprivation and missed medication on the seizure propensity in patients with epilepsy. Clinical evidence point towards the fact that epileptic seizures are not random and are instead precipitated by triggers specific to each patient. Some of these triggers act instantaneously, for instance, flashing lights triggering seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. Others take some time to manifest, for instance, stress or sleep deprivation. I am working on a way to translate this clinical evidence into mathematical models that could help forecast seizures and devise interventions to prevent a seizure.\nMy research is directly shaped by the \u0026lsquo;Perturbations in Epilepsy\u0026rsquo; workshop that I co-organise along with my colleagues at the SMQB. Every year, we bring together a range of stakeholders to inform our research on epilepsy,\nPatients and carers - to share their experiences on how epilepsy affects their lives and hear the factors that they think are affecting their seizures. Clinicians - to share their expertise on different epilepsy syndromes and the mechnaisms by which they are affected by various seizure triggers. Academics - to help with mathematical modelling, and data collection, analysis and interpretation. Industry partners - primarily from the health monitoring and diagnostics space to discuss the feasibility of long-term monitoring of factors such as heart rate variability, sleep duration and stress levels. The first edition of the workshop took place in April 2022 and we are planning to organise the second in June 2023.\nI am open to new collaborations, and would like to particularly hear from graduate students - I have some interesting problems to work on!\n","date":"April 14, 2022","permalink":"/research/","section":"Home","summary":"I hold a PhD in Applied Mechanics from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, with my thesis focussing on enhancing the power obtained from piezoelectric energy harvesters.","title":"Research"},{"content":"Hi! I am Aravind, an engineer, applied mathematician, neuroscientist, and above all, a curious individual by heart. My curiosity has led me to observe how things evolve with time and question why they do so. There is a branch of mathematics that looks into this - dynamical systems, and it forms the core of my research. I think we can all agree that the world would be a far boring place to live if not for the nonlinearity and randomness. Naturally, this extends to my research as well, and I focus on nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems.\nI started out as a Mechanical Engineer, and went on to do a PhD in Applied Mechanics from Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
