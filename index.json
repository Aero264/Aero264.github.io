Energy harvesters are small devices that can convert otherwise wasted energy, such as heat and vibrations in the environment, into a small amount of electricity. One could then use this electricity to power wireless sensors and small devices - for instance, a vibration energy harvester could use vibrations from a railway track to power sensors that monitor structural integrity of the tracks. I worked on how we could enhance the performance of vibration energy harvesters that use piezoelectric transduction to generate energy.\nAfter completing my PhD, I moved to the UK to work on the development of a software package that enables bottom-up modelling of helicopters at the University of Bristol. I was part of a Â£3.5 million project involving multiple UK universities to develop new experimental and computational methods for the analysis of tiltrotor helicopters. My task was to develop a software framework that could allow designing of the individual components of the helicopter, and then automatically assembles them to simulate the motion of the entire helicopter. I developed a comprehensive software capable of simulating any mechanical system, not just a helicopter. However, there are some limitations - the software could handle only rigid systems. Researchers at Bristol continue to work on the software, adding more functionality, including the capability to model flexible systems, while I have moved to Birmingham since October 2021 in the pursuit of diversifying my knowledge.\nCurrently, I am a Research Fellow in Computational Neuroscience at the Center for Systems Modelling and Quantitative Biomedicine (SMQB) at the Univeristy of Birmingham, UK. I am investigating the effects of triggers such as stress, sleep deprivation and missed medication on the seizure propensity in patients with epilepsy. Clinical evidence point towards the fact that epileptic seizures are not random and are instead precipitated by triggers specific to each patient. Some of these triggers act instantaneously, for instance, flashing lights triggering seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. Others take some time to manifest, for instance, stress or sleep deprivation. I am working on a way to translate this clinical evidence into mathematical models that could help forecast seizures and devise interventions to prevent a seizure.\nMy research is directly shaped by the \u0026lsquo;Perturbations in Epilepsy\u0026rsquo; workshop that I co-organise along with my colleagues at the SMQB. Every year, we bring together a range of stakeholders to inform our research on epilepsy,\nPatients and carers - to share their experiences on how epilepsy affects their lives and hear the factors that they think are affecting their seizures. Clinicians - to share their expertise on different epilepsy syndromes and the mechnaisms by which they are affected by various seizure triggers. Academics - to help with mathematical modelling, and data collection, analysis and interpretation. Industry partners - primarily from the health monitoring and diagnostics space to discuss the feasibility of long-term monitoring of factors such as heart rate variability, sleep duration and stress levels. The first iteration of the workshop took place in April 2022 and we are planning to organise the second one in March 2023.\nI am open to new collaborations, and would like to particularly hear from graduate students - I have some interesting problems to work on!\n","date":"14 April 2022","permalink":"/research/","section":"Home","summary":"I hold a PhD in Applied Mechanics from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, with my thesis focussing on enhancing the power obtained from piezoelectric energy harvesters.","title":"Research"},{"content":"Hi! I am Aravind, an engineer, applied mathematician, and neuroscientist and above all, a curious individual by heart. My curiosity has led me to observe how things evolve with time and question why they do so. There is a branch of mathematics that looks into this - dynamical systems, and it forms the core of my research. I think we can all agree that the world would be a far boring place to live if not for the nonlinearity and randomness. Naturally, this extends to my research as well, and I focus on nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems.\nI started out as a Mechanical Engineer, and went on to do a PhD in Applied Mechanics from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Subsequently, I moved to the UK to work on the modelling of helicopters at the University of Bristol.\nI am currently a Research Fellow in Computational Neuroscience at the Center for Systems Modelling and Quantitative Biomedicine (SMQB) at the University of Birmingham, UK. I am investigating the effects of triggers such as stress, sleep deprivation and missed medication on the propensity to initiate a seizure in patients with epilepsy. I am translating clinical evidence into a mathematical formulation that could help forecast seizures and devise interventions to prevent a seizure.\nOther than research, I like all things transportation - buses, trains and airlines. I run virtual airlines in the airline management game AirlineSim and follow the airline industry closely in the real world as well.\nPlease get in touch through Twitter ( @AravindKumar264) to chat about math, neuroscience, air travel or anything of mutual interest.\n","date":"14 April 2022","permalink":"/aboutme/","section":"Home","summary":"Hi!
