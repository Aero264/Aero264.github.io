I am currently investigating the effects of triggers such as stress, sleep deprivation and missed medication on the seizure propensity in patients with epilepsy. Clinical evidence point towards the fact that epileptic seizures are not random and are instead precipitated by triggers specific to each patient. Some of these triggers act instantaneously, for instance, flashing lights triggering seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. Others take some time to manifest, for instance, stress or sleep deprivation. I am working on a way to translate this clinical evidence into mathematical models that could help forecast seizures and devise interventions to prevent a seizure.\nI hold a PhD in Applied Mechanics from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, with my thesis focussing on enhancing the power obtained from piezoelectric energy harvesters. Energy harvesters are small devices that can convert otherwise wasted energy, such as heat and vibrations in the environment, into a small amount of electricity. One could then use this electricity to power wireless sensors and small devices - for instance, a vibration energy harvester could use vibrations from a railway track to power sensors that monitor structural integrity of the tracks. I worked on how we could enhance the performance of vibration energy harvesters that use piezoelectric transduction to generate energy.\nAfter completing my PhD, I moved to the UK to work on the development of a software package that enables bottom-up modelling of helicopters at the University of Bristol. I was part of a Â£3.5 million project involving multiple UK universities to develop new experimental and computational methods for the analysis of tiltrotor helicopters. My task was to develop a software tool that could allow designing of the individual components of the helicopter, and then assemble them to simulate the motion of the entire helicopter. I developed a comprehensive software capable of simulating any mechanical system, not just a helicopter. However, there are some limitations - the software could handle only rigid systems. Researchers at Bristol continue to work on the software, adding more functionality, including the capability to model flexible systems, while I have moved to Birmingham since October 2021 in the pursuit of diversifying my knowledge.\n","date":"April 14, 2022","permalink":"/research/","section":"Home","summary":"I took up my current position as a Research Fellow in Computational Neuroscience at the Univeristy of Birmingham in October 2021.","title":"Research"},{"content":"Hi! I am Aravind, an engineer by education, an applied mathematician by profession, and a curious individual by heart. My curiosity has led me to observe how things evolve with time and question why they do so. There is a branch of mathematics that looks into this - dynamical systems, and it forms the core of my research. I think we can all agree that the world would be a far boring place to live if not for the nonlinearity and randomness. Naturally, this extends to my research as well, and I focus on nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems.\nI am currently a Research Fellow in Computational Neuroscience at the Center for Systems Modelling and Quantitative Biomedicine at the University of Birmingham, UK. I am investigating how triggers like stress and sleep deprivation may lead to a seizure in patients with epilepsy. To do so, I am translating clinical evidence into a mathematical formulation, with the ultimate objective of building a model that could help forecast seizures and devise interventions to prevent a seizure.\nI like all things transportation - buses, trains and airlines. I am a huge fan of city building and transportation games, and currently play games like Cities Skylines, Simutrans and Nimby Rails in PC, and Theotown in Android. I also run virtual airlines in the airline management game AirlineSim. I follow the airline industry closely in the real world as well, and occasionally tweet about the important developments. Get in touch through Twitter\n(   @AravindKumar264) to chat about airline loyalty programmes and associated credit cards in the UK, new routes in India and the UK, and any exciting news about the industry at large.\n","date":"April 14, 2022","permalink":"/aboutme/","section":"Home","summary":"Hi!
