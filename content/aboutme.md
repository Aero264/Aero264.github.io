Description: "About Dr. Aravind Kumar Kamaraj - Research Fellow at SMQB"
---

Hi! I am Aravind, an engineer, applied mathematician, neuroscientist, and above all, a curious individual by heart. My curiosity has led me to observe how things evolve with time and question why they do so. There is a branch of mathematics that looks into this - **dynamical systems**, and it forms the core of my research. I think we can all agree that the world would be a far boring place to live if not for the nonlinearity and randomness. Naturally, this extends to my research as well, and I focus on nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems. 

I started out as a Mechanical Engineer, and went on to do a PhD in Applied Mechanics from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Subsequently, I moved to the UK to work on the modelling of helicopters at the University of Bristol. 

I am currently a **Research Fellow in Computational Neuroscience** at the Center for Systems Modelling and Quantitative Biomedicine (SMQB) at the **University of Birmingham, UK**. I am investigating the effects of triggers such as stress, sleep deprivation and missed medication on the propensity to initiate a seizure in patients with epilepsy. I am translating clinical evidence into a mathematical formulation that could help forecast seizures and devise interventions to prevent a seizure.

Other than research, I like all things transportation - buses, trains and airlines. I run virtual airlines in the airline management game [AirlineSim](https://www.airlinesim.aero/en) and follow the airline industry closely in the real world as well.
