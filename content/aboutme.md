Description: "About Dr. Aravind Kumar Kamaraj"
---

I am **Aravind**, trained as an **engineer and applied mathematician**, and now working as a **neuroscientist**. At the core of my work is a long-standing curiosity about how systems evolve over time and why they behave the way they do. This naturally led me to dynamical systems theory, which forms the backbone of my research. Real-world systems are rarely linear, predictable, or noise-free --- and that is precisely what makes them interesting. My work therefore focuses on **nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems**, both as mathematical objects and as tools for understanding complex biological phenomena. 

My career trajectory mirrors my interest in nonlinearity. I trained initially as a mechanical engineer and completed a **PhD in Applied Mechanics at IIT Madras**, working on nonlinear dynamical systems in engineering contexts. I then moved to the UK, first applying these ideas to rotorcraft modelling at the **University of Bristol**, before transitioning into **computational neuroscience** at the **University of Birmingham**. Rather than a change in intellectual direction, these moves reflect a gradual shift in application domain. In May 2024, I joined the **University of Surrey** to work in a **clinical research environment**, with the explicit aim of bringing mechanistic modelling closer to patient-relevant questions.

I am currently the **Principal Investigator** on a **UK Dementia Research Institute Pilot Award** at the Surrey Sleep Research Centre. My work focuses on the collection and analysis of human scalp EEG to characterise differences between **healthy ageing and Alzheimer’s disease**, with particular emphasis on identifying markers of epileptic activity. I have developed and validated a **comprehensive EEG analysis pipeline in MATLAB**, covering artefact handling, spectral and connectivity analyses, event detection, and statistical summarisation. This framework has been applied consistently across **multiple cohorts**, including young adults, healthy older adults, and individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.

Looking ahead, my aim is to study the brain explicitly as a **living dynamical system** --- one that adapts, fluctuates, and occasionally fails. By combining **mechanistic modelling** with **human neurophysiological data**, I am interested in understanding how normal brain function emerges from interacting processes across scales, and how co-morbid diseases reflect disruptions to these dynamics rather than isolated effects. I see this **systems-level perspective** as essential for developing interpretable biomarkers and interventions that meaningfully connect theory, data, and clinical practice.
