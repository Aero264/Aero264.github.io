Hi! I am Aravind, an engineer by education, an applied mathematician by profession, and a curious individual by heart. My curiosity has led me to observe how things evolve with time and question why they do so. There is a branch of mathematics that looks into this - **dynamical systems**, and it forms the core of my research. I think we can all agree that the world would be a far boring place to live if not for the nonlinearity and randomness. Naturally, this extends to my research as well, and I focus on nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems. 

I am currently a **Research Fellow in Computational Neuroscience** at the Center for Systems Modelling and Quantitative Biomedicine at the **University of Birmingham, UK**. I am investigating how triggers like stress and sleep deprivation may lead to a seizure in patients with epilepsy. To do so, I am translating clinical evidence into a mathematical formulation, with the ultimate objective of building a model that could help forecast seizures and devise interventions to prevent a seizure.

I like all things transportation - buses, trains and airlines. I am a huge fan of city building and transportation games, and currently play games like Cities Skylines, Simutrans and Nimby Rails in PC, and Theotown in Android. I also run virtual airlines in the airline management game [AirlineSim](https://www.airlinesim.aero/en). I follow the airline industry closely in the real world as well, and occasionally tweet about the important developments. Get in touch through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AravindKumar264)
